('about_us', 'Sunday Dog is very much an extension of our lifestyle with our six dogs at home. As they are a big part of our life, we want to make sure that we''re getting them the best, when it comes to shopping for them.  Realizing how hard it is to find products that we really, really like in a pet store, we decided to have our own place which carries only quality stuff we would want for our dogs, and that fits our lifestyle....and that''s how Sunday Dog started. Our selections of goods are only those we think worthy of consideration, that we would only want for our dogs and our home. We love quality and well-designed products. In addition, we love all those thoughtful products that have a great story behind them. Things that contribute positively to society!...We really hope you''ll like our selections as much as we do.'),
